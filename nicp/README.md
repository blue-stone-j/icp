NICP (Normal Iterative Closest Point)
====

NICP is a novel on-line method to recursively align point clouds. This method
exploits the 3D structure to determine the data association between the two
clouds taking into account each point and its local features of the surface:
normals and curvature.
This method adopt a line of sight criterion to find the corresponding points between
the two clouds to register. This, together with the efficient algorithms and
data structures used by NICP, increase the speed of the method allowing
real-time computation.
NICP solves the alignment problem by casting a least squares formulation that
minimizes an error metric depending on both the point coordinates and the
associated normal. This renders the algorithm more robust and accurate, thus
computing better transformation.

Examples
----

Once you compiled the code you will have the following exmaple binaries:
- `nicp_simple_aligner` is a binary that, given a set of depth images and a .txt file containing the list of depth images to align, perform the point cloud registrations
- `nicp_aligner` same as nicp_simple_aligner, but it uses an incremental version of the algorithm
- `nicp_aligner_gui` is a simple GUI for point cloud alignment, several parameters of the algorithm can be modified with GUI buttons
- `nicp_cloud_prop_viewer` simple GUI to see basic properties of a depth image / point cloud
- `nicp_simple_viewer` is a GUI that given a folder allows to visualize all the point clouds, saved in .nicp format, in the folder
