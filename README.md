### introduction

### TODO
1. Make sure code can run on ubuntu 22.04.
2. Find essential dependencies.
3. Better to make a docker image.(It's much more diffcult today, because all docker repositories are blocked in China.)

### ICP
Simple and traditional ICP implementation.

### Normal ICP
1. Take into account each point and its local features of the surface: normals and curvature.
2. Provide a viewer based on opengl and qt.
